# FSM
This project implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) in Verilog to detect the 101 bit pattern in a serial input stream. The FSM transitions through defined states based on input values and asserts an output when the target pattern is recognized. Supports overlapping pattern detection and is written in a clean, synthesizable style.
